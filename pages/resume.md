# Resume
Great! You made it here! Now lets relax and _**have some fun**_. Let me show what I do, and maybe you can enjoy a little bit more... 

## Technologies

Before showcasing the projects, let me introduce you to my prefered techonlogies for both backend and frontend.

- **Backend**: My _goto_ language for developing backend technologies is [PHP](https://www.php.net/) with the [Symfony Framework](https://symfony.com/). 

  I know, I know... there are more cool languages out there, i know them myself also, NodeJS + ExpresJS, maybe Python + DJango, but if you want to go on the cheap, almost all the servers with a fairly low price only understand PHP.

- **Frontend**: Android. Recently I discovered that I could speed things up if i use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/), so thats what I have been developing recently, but for other projects (TV ones) flutter is not an option, so Android/Java.

  On the web, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for doing all the html styling, and some useful templates, like [AdminLTE](https://adminlte.io/).

  Wish for next vacation period, Android/Kotlin, maybe ReactJS, Angular...

  _Also, good all Java Swing, if I happen to develop any Desktop App_

### Lets see my [work](/projects)
