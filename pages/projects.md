# Projects
Here is a small peak of what I usually do on my spare time, I hope you like it:

- **CSBook**: Project that aims to organize and easily distribute the songs that my choir sings every sunday service at my church. It has song/version management, chord management, multi paris/church support, multi service support, export to word, export to chordpro and songbook generation just to quote some. _Code will be realase soon..._
  > You can find it running [here](https://parroquias.csbook.es), and some tutorials (in Spanish) [here](https://hkfuertes.github.io/csbguide/).

- **[CSBook Flutter App](https://github.com/hkfuertes/csbook_app)\***: Simple App _in read only mode_ for the `CSBook` backend. With the ability to search for songs, modify the key, view all the Masses and view their chords. _You just need this app to play the guitar in any service or payer that you ar at._

- **CSBook FiresStick App**: Another client for CSBook, but this is meant to be used with the [Amazon FireStick TV](https://www.amazon.es/gp/product/B07PVCVBN7/ref=k-xs_es_ups_dz_tkl) so that the masses created with the backend can be slideshowed during the service.
_Code will be realase soon..._

- **[Lecturas Flutter App](https://github.com/hkfuertes/Lecturas)\***: This is another simple app in flutter. The main goal is to have a centralized place to read the daily Sacred Scripts, and to have the ability to write a personal though about them to revisit it later.
  >Lecturas 1.0.0beta [download](https://github.com/hkfuertes/Lecturas/releases/download/1.0.0beta/Lecturas.beta.apk).

- **[Blood Preasure & Weight Management Platform](https://github.com/hkfuertes/tension-app-server-sql)**: Backend project in NodeJS and SQL to store a private database of Blood preasure and Weight measures.

- **[Blood Preasure & Weight Management Flutter App](https://github.com/hkfuertes/tension-app-flutter) \***: _**My very First Flutter app!**_ The aim of this app is to be a client for the Blood Preasure and Weight management system described above.

- **[PlayMax.TV](https://github.com/hkfuertes/PlayMax.TV)** [_Deprecated_]: With this project, you were able to connect to [PlayMax](https://playmax.mx) back in the day when you had links for several services. _I havent use this app in time, so I don't expect it to work_ but is a really good example of how to use Android's Leanback Library.

- **[Eventus](https://github.com/hkfuertes/eventus)**: Final Degree Project back in college. Its a "mini-facebook", the idea behind this is to create a public space in where to upload photos and share comments in an ephimeral way, for example a wedding. The site is available for as long as the bride and groom decide it to be. Past that time, the site gets erased.

- **[Eventus Android App](https://github.com/hkfuertes/eventus-android)**: Pure Android client for the `Eventus` platform.

 **\*** _Flutter apps, right now tested and developed on Android as I dont have a Mac to test the iOS comeout._
