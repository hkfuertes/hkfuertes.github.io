<h3 id="technologies">Technologies</h3>

<p>Before showcasing the projects, let me introduce you to my prefered techonlogies for both backend and frontend.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Backend</strong>: My <em>goto</em> language for developing backend technologies is <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> with the <a href="https://symfony.com/">Symfony Framework</a>.</p>

    <p>I know, I know… there are more cool languages out there, i know them myself also, NodeJS + ExpresJS, maybe Python + DJango, but if you want to go on the cheap, almost all the servers with a fairly low price only understand PHP.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Frontend</strong>: Android. Recently I discovered that I could speed things up if i use <a href="https://flutter.dev/">Flutter</a>, so thats what I have been developing recently, but for other projects (TV ones) flutter is not an option, so Android/Java.</p>

    <p>On the web, <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> for doing all the html styling, and some useful templates, like <a href="https://adminlte.io/">AdminLTE</a>.</p>

    <p>Wish for next vacation period, Android/Kotlin, maybe ReactJS, Angular…</p>

    <p><em>Also, good all Java Swing, if I happen to develop any Desktop App</em></p>
